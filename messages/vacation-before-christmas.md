Dear sender,
I'm currently out of office and will be back on the 14th of December. Sadly not laying somewhere on the 🏝. But probably I’m out somewhere in the 🌳🌲🌳🌲 searching a nice 🎄.
I definitely have access to my mails 📬 but be ensured I won’t read or respond to them.

--foreach - $Topic1, please contact $Topic1Contact --end

Best Regards

David
